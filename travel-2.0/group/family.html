							<p>Your family member who is the Canadian citizen or permanent resident must fill out the <a
									href="https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/ircc/documents/pdf/english/kits/forms/imm0006e-2020-10-09.pdf">application for authorization and
									statutory declaration (IMM 0006) (PDF, 2.2 MB)</a>.&nbsp;<span class="label label-info">Updated October 9,

							<h4>Step 3: Your family member signs the form by solemn declaration</h4>
							<p>Once you’ve sent the form back to your family member in Canada, they must sign the form by solemn declaration. This
								is done in front of any official who is legally authorized to receive a solemn declaration, such as a commissioner for
								oaths, justice of the peace, lawyer or notary public.</p>
							<h4>Step 4: Get a copy of the completed and signed form</h4>
							<p>Your family member in Canada must send you a copy of the completed and signed <a
									href="https://www.canada.ca//content/dam/ircc/documents/pdf/english/kits/forms/imm0006e-2020-10-09.pdf">application for authorization and

									other country.</strong></p>

								visa or eTA).</p>
							<p><a href="#request-ircc-extended">Find out how to request authorization</a></p>

								authorization with you when you travel.</h4>
							<p>You must have a copy of the application for authorization and statutory declaration as well as the written
								authorization with you when you travel. This is mandatory. If not, you won’t be allowed to board your flight or enter
