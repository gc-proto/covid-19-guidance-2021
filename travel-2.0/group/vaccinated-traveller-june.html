            <li><a
                  href="https://travel.gc.ca/travel-covid/travel-restrictions/flying-canada-checklist/covid-19-testing-travellers-coming-into-canada#getting-tested">Pre-entry

                  testing for land travellers</a></li>
         </ul>
         <h3>Quarantine plan</h3>
         <p>You must have a <a
               href="https://travel.gc.ca/travel-covid/travel-restrictions/isolation#quarantine">suitable quarantine
               plan</a> in place where you can stay for at least 14 days. This is required even if you are seeking the
            fully vaccinated exemption. </p>
         <p>Final determination is made by a government representative at the border based on the information presented
            at the time of entry into Canada. You must therefore be prepared to quarantine for 14 days, in case you:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>are symptomatic</li>
            <li>don’t meet the requirements</li>
         </ul>
         <p>If you don’t meet the requirements, you'll be asked to follow the instructions provided by the government
            representative.</p>
         <p>If you meet all the requirements, you won't need to quarantine.</p>
         <details>
            <summary>Travelling with minors or dependents who are not vaccinated</summary>
            <p>Unvaccinated minors or dependent adults who are travelling with fully vaccinated travellers
               must quarantine for 14 days and follow all testing requirements, but are not required to stay at a
               government-authorized hotel.</p>
         </details>
         <p>Provinces and territories may have their own border measures as well as public health guidelines, so it's important that travellers check for the most up-to-date travel
            requirements for the province or territory of destination.</p>

         <p>Follow the instructions provided to you upon entry
            to Canada to complete your arrival (day 1)
            test. Airports and some land borders have on-site
            testing or sample observation services where you can complete your test before
            continuing on to your destination.</p>
         <p>If you receive a home test kit instead, complete it on the day you arrive and send it to the lab following
            the
            instructions provided.</p>
         <p>If your arrival test is negative:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>follow local public health measures</li>
            <li>maintain a list of all close contacts for your first 14 days in Canada</li>
            <li>keep copies of your proof of vaccination for 14 days</li>
         </ul>
         <p>If your arrival test is positive:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>isolate yourself from others right away</li>
            <li>you will be contacted by your local public health authority</li>
            <li>follow their instructions </li>
            <li>keep copies of your proof of vaccination for 14 days</li>
         </ul>
         <h2 id="how-to-meet">How to meet the fully vaccinated exemption</h2>
         <p>You must use ArriveCAN to enter your proof of vaccination, quarantine and travel information. You must enter
            this information within 72 hours before your arrival in Canada.</p>
         <p><strong>If you don't provide the required information in ArriveCAN before arriving at the border you won't
               be
               considered for the exemption, even if you meet all the other requirements.</strong></p>
         <p>If you meet the exemption, you may receive notifications from ArriveCAN; however, you won't be required to
            send in reports.</p>
         <h3 id="proof">Providing proof of your vaccination</h3>
         <p>In ArriveCAN, <strong>you must provide</strong>:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>the details of your first dose (date, country and vaccine you received)</li>
            <li>the details of your second dose if one was required (i.e., for Pfizer, Moderna, and AstraZeneca
               vaccines)</li>
            <li>a photo(s) or PDF file(s) of the record of your vaccination(s), such as receipts or confirmations from
               the vaccinating organization. These must be in English, French, or a certified translation into English
               or French.</li>
         </ul>
         <p>If your proof of vaccination doesn't meet all of the requirements it will be considered invalid and you
            will be required to:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>stay a government-authorized hotel to await the results of your arrival test before continuing on to
               your place of quarantine</li>
            <li>complete a quarantine period of at least 14 days</li>
            <li>complete a test on day 8 of your quarantine </li>
         </ul>
         <p>Final determination of your vaccination status will be made at the border. You must bring a digital or paper
            copy of your proof(s) of vaccination with you.</p>
         <h2 id="partially-vaccinated">No exceptions for
            partially-vaccinated travellers</h3>
            <p>At this time, there are no exemptions from testing, hotel stopover or quarantine for travellers who
               haven't received the full series of a vaccine or a combination of vaccines accepted by the Government of
               Canada.
