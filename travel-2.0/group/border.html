      <p>The COVID-19 pandemic restricts travel to Canada and within Canada. It is essential to understand and comply
         with the requirements.</p>

      <h2 id="border">At the border</h2>
      <p>You will be assessed, regardless of citizenship, upon arrival to Canada. Entry screening is one of many
         important public health tools. It is part of a multi-layered government response strategy.</p>
      <p>When you arrive in Canada by air or land, a Border Services Officer will ask you:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>the purpose of your trip</li>
         <li>whether you are feeling ill or unwell</li>
         <li>other questions as needed to complete their assessment</li>
      </ul>
      <p>CBSA officers will look for signs of illness, regardless of how you respond to screening questions. Officers
         will refer any traveller they suspect is ill for a further medical assessment by the Public Health Agency of
         Canada.</p>
      <p>You must:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>wear a mask</li>
