      <p>Fully vaccinated travellers must follow the entry requirements:</p>

      <h3>Pre-entry test</h3>
      <ul>
         <li><a
               href="/travel-covid/travel-restrictions/flying-canada-checklist/covid-19-testing-travellers-coming-into-canada#getting-tested">Pre-entry

               testing for land travellers</a></li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Quarantine plan</h3>
      <p>You must have a <a href="/travel-covid/travel-restrictions/isolation#quarantine">suitable quarantine
            plan</a> in place where you can stay for at least 14 days. This is required even if you are seeking the
         fully vaccinated exemption. </p>
      <p>Final determination is made by a government representative at the border based on the information presented
         at the time of entry into Canada. You must therefore be prepared to quarantine for 14 days, in case you:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>are symptomatic</li>
         <li>don’t meet the requirements</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you don’t meet the requirements, you'll be asked to follow the instructions provided by the government
         representative.</p>
      <p>If you meet all the requirements, you won't need to quarantine.</p>

      <p>Provinces and territories may have their own border measures as well as public health guidelines, so it's
         important that travellers check for the most up-to-date travel
         requirements for the province or territory of destination.</p>

      <p>Follow the instructions provided to you upon entry
         to Canada to complete your arrival (day 1)
         test. Airports and some land borders have on-site
         testing or sample observation services where you can complete your test before
         continuing on to your destination.</p>
      <p>If you receive a home test kit instead, complete it on the day you arrive and send it to the lab following
         the
         instructions provided.</p>
      <p>If your arrival test is negative:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>follow local public health measures</li>
         <li>maintain a list of all close contacts for your first 14 days in Canada</li>

      <p>You must use ArriveCAN to enter your proof of vaccination, quarantine and travel information. </p>
      <p><mark>STATUS?</mark>The new version of ArriveCAN will be released on July 5, 2021. You will not be able to
         upload your proof of vaccination into ArriveCAN until that time.
      </p>
      <p>If you <strong>don't</strong> provide the required information in ArriveCAN before arriving at the border
         you <strong>won't</strong> be considered for the exemption, even if you meet all the other

      <p>If you meet the exemption, you may receive notifications from ArriveCAN; however, you won't be required to
