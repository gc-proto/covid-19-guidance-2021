    <p>Although your reason for entering Canada may fall under an exemption, you may still have to follow certain
        provincial
        and territorial restrictions (which may include quarantine), depending on your destination.</p>

        <p>It is the traveller’s responsibility to demonstrate that they are eligible to enter Canada, including if
            they qualify for an exemption from mandatory testing or quarantine measures.</p>
        <p>Government representatives at the border use the information available at the time of entry to determine
            what instructions will be provided to a traveller regarding their public health obligations.</p>
        <p>Travellers must meet the relevant criteria to be considered an essential service provider under the
            Emergency Orders. They may be exempt from the mandatory requirements if they meet the relevant criteria and
            they
            are entering for the purpose of that function. Travellers who are exempt from quarantine as essential
            service providers, are workers whose job is included in the Chief Public Health Officer Group Exemption
            list.
        </p>
        <p>When you enter Canada, a government representative will ask questions and consider multiple factors,
            including supporting documents and your previous travel history. They may ask for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>your identification and proof of residence</li>
            <li>confirmation of employment</li>
            <li>confirmation of your normal place of employment</li>
            <li>confirmation of your past travel history to establish a pattern of travel frequency</li>
            <li>if required, demonstrated immediate nature of work required in Canada and why you are unable to
                quarantine for 14 days</li>
            <li>documentation from your employer as to why the travel is required and how the travel meets one of
                the exemptions under the Emergency Order</li>
        </ul>
