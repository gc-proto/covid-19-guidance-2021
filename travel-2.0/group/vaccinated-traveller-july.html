            for fully vaccinated travellers</h2>
         <p><strong>Travel restrictions on who can enter Canada remain in place.</strong></p>
         <p> You may qualify for certain exemptions, if you:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>are allowed to enter Canada </li>
            <li>are asymptomatic</li>
            <li>meet all the criteria of a fully vaccinated traveller</li>

            <li>exemption from the 3-night hotel stopover for air travellers</li>
            <li>exemption from the day-8 testing requirement</li>
         </ul>
         <p>Fully vaccinated travellers must follow the entry requirements:</p>
         <h3>Pre-entry test</h3>
         <ul>
            <li><a
                  href="https://travel.gc.ca/travel-covid/travel-restrictions/flying-canada-checklist/covid-19-testing-travellers-coming-into-canada#getting-tested">Getting
                  tested to enter Canada</a></li>
         </ul>
         <h3>Quarantine and hotel stopover</h3>
         <p>You must have a <a
               href="https://travel.gc.ca/travel-covid/travel-restrictions/isolation#quarantine">suitable quarantine
               plan</a> in place where you can stay for at least 14 days. If you have symptoms
            or an unsuitable quarantine plan, you will be asked to follow the instructions provided by the
            government representative at the border. </p>
         <p>If you meet the criteria of fully vaccinated you must go directly to your place of quarantine to await
            results of your arrival test </p>
         <p>Air travellers who meet the criteria do not need to stay at a government-authorized hotel to await results
            of their arrival test.</p>
         <p><strong>Unvaccinated minors</strong> or dependent adults who are travelling with fully vaccinated travellers
            must quarantine for 14 days and follow all testing requirements, but are not required to stay at a
            government-authorized hotel.</p>
         <p>You may travel to your place of quarantine using:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>private vehicle</li>
            <li>onward domestic flight</li>
            <li>other means of public transportation</li>
         </ul>
         <p>While in transit, you must follow all public health measures, such as wearing a
            mask.</p>
         <p>Provinces and territories may have their own provincial border measures as well as public health guidelines
            within their jurisdictions, so it is important that travellers check for the most up-to-date travel
            requirements for the province or territory of destination.</p>

               restrictions</a></p>
         <h3>Arrival testing</h3>
         <p>Follow the instructions provided to you upon entry
            to Canada to complete your arrival (day 1)
            test. Airports and some land borders have on-site
            services where you can complete your test before
            continuing on to your place of quarantine.
         </p>
         <p>If you receive a home test kit, complete it on the day you arrive and send it to the lab following the
            instructions provided.</p>
         <p>If your arrival test is negative:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>your mandatory quarantine period is complete
               and you may now leave quarantine
            </li>
            <li>you may continue to receive emails and notifications from ArriveCAN after you’ve left quarantine, but
               you don’t need to do daily reports</li>
            <li>follow local public health measures</li>
            <li>maintain a list of all close contacts for your first 14 days in Canada</li>
            <li>keep copies of your proof of vaccination for 14 days</li>
         </ul>
         <p>If your arrival test is positive or someone in your travel party receives a positive test result:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>do not leave your place of quarantine</li>
            <li>begin a 14-day isolation period:
               <ul>
                  <li>if your test was done under supervision of the test provider (e.g. video call or on-site at the
                     border), start your isolation on the date you took your test</li>
                  <li>if your test was not supervised by the test provider, start your isolation on the date on the test
                     result</li>
               </ul>
            <li>keep copies of your proof of vaccination until your isolation period is complete</li>
            <li>you may continue to receive emails and notifications from ArriveCAN after you’ve left quarantine, but
               you don’t need to do daily reports</li>
            <li>you will be contacted by Government of
               Canada and provincial or territorial officials </li>
         </ul>
         <h2>How to meet the full vaccinated exemption</h2>
         <p>To be considered fully vaccinated, you must have received the full series of a vaccine – or a combination of
            vaccines – accepted by the Government of Canada at least 14 days prior to entering Canada.</p>
         <p><strong>You must also use ArriveCAN</strong> to enter your vaccination, quarantine and travel information.
            You may enter this information within 72 hours before to arrival in Canada.</p>
         <h3>Authorized vaccines for proof of vaccination</h3>
         <p>At this time, Canada is only accepting vaccines
            authorized by Health Canada. If you received one or a combination of these vaccines outside Canada, it’s
            still accepted, so long as you received the full dose series. The list of accepted vaccines may expand in
            the future.</p>
