		<h2 id="exempt">Requirements for exempt travellers</h2>
		<p>There are strict requirements you must follow even if you are exempt from quarantine.</p>
		<p>You must:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>wear a mask at all times when in public spaces</li>
			<li>maintain a list of all close contacts for your first 14 days in Canada</li>
			<li>monitor yourself for signs and symptoms of COVID-19</li>

			<summary id="border-documents">Crossing the border for work: documents you may need</summary>
			<p>It is the traveller’s responsibility to demonstrate that they are eligible to enter Canada, including if
				they
				qualify for an exemption from mandatory testing or quarantine measures.</p>
			<p>Government representatives at the border use the information available at the time of entry to determine
				what
				instructions will be provided to a traveller regarding their public health obligations.</p>
			<p>Travellers must meet the relevant criteria to be considered an essential service provider under the
				Emergency
				Orders. They may be exempt from the mandatory requirements if they meet the relevant criteria and they
				are
				entering for the purpose of that function. Travellers who are exempt from quarantine as essential
				service
				providers, are workers whose job is included in the Chief Public Health Officer Group Exemption list.
			</p>
			<p>When you enter Canada, a government representative will ask questions and consider multiple factors,
				including supporting documents and your previous travel history. They may ask for:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>your identification and proof of residence</li>
				<li>confirmation of employment</li>
				<li>confirmation of your normal place of employment</li>
				<li>confirmation of your past travel history to establish a pattern of travel frequency</li>
				<li>if required, demonstrated immediate nature of work required in Canada and why you are unable to
					quarantine for 14 days</li>
				<li>documentation from your employer as to why the travel is required and how the travel meets one of
					the
					exemptions under the Emergency Order</li>
