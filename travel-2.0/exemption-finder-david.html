		<h1>Travel quarantine, hotel and testing exemptions</h1>
		<p>There are travel restrictions in place at all border crossings to reduce the spread of COVID-19 by travellers entering Canada. If you
			aren't sure whether these restrictions apply to you, answer a few questions to:<br>
			<a href="https://travel.gc.ca/travel-covid/travel-restrictions/wizard-start">Find out if you can enter
				Canada</a>
		</p>

		<p>Find out if your work or personal situation are exempt from quarantine or testing requirements.</p>
		<p><strong>Exempt means that you don't have to follow certain requirements</strong>. For example, if you are exempt from quarantine, you don't need to quarantine for 14 days after entering Canada or stay at a government-authorized hotel.</p>


		<h2>Who is exempt from quarantine, hotel, and testing</h2>
<p>Filter by keywords to find work roles and personal situations that may be exempt from quarantine, or from COVID-19 testing either before or after your entry into Canada. </p>
<p>Follow the links for your situation or role to check the details for exemptions. For some, you must be performing work within a certain amount of time, or be providing a very specific type of service.</p>
