		<summary><mark>Including multiple people in your submission</mark></summary>
	
	<h3><mark>Families</mark></h3>
		<p>As the primary traveller, you may provide travel information for yourself and for:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>your spouse or common law partner</li>
			<li>your children (or children for whom you have legal guardianship), aged 18 years or younger</li>
			<li>any other adult for whom you're a legal guardian</li>
		</ul>
		
	

		<h3><mark>Group travel</mark></h3>
		<p>You can provide information for up to 8 travellers, including yourself, in a single submission. Use this when:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>you'll all stay together at the same address for the entire quarantine or isolation period <strong>and</strong></li>
			<li>you have their permission to collect and share this information</li>
		</ul>
		
			<p>If you're travelling with a child whose only documentation is a birth certificate, you don't need to submit their information in ArriveCAN. You'll be provided with an alternative option at the Canadian border.</p>

		<p>You'll need to fill out ArriveCAN with all of the traveller's information.</p>
		<p>You'll then be able to print or email the receipt to the traveller.</p>
		<p>You must send the receipt to the traveller to show to the Canada border services officer upon arrival to Canada. The traveller is responsible for ensuring they're compliant with the requirements for entry into Canada.</p>
		<p>The traveller cannot use ArriveCAN to complete their post-border reporting; they must call&nbsp;<strong>1-833-641-0343</strong> each day during their 14-day quarantine.</p>

		<details>
		  <summary>If you qualified for the fully vaccinated traveller exemption</summary>
		  <p>You may receive notifications and/or emails from ArriveCAN asking you to complete your daily reporting. Follow the instructions of the border services officer given to you at the time of entry, including the paper handout.</p>
		</details>
		<details>
		  <summary>If you didn't qualify for the fully vaccinated traveller exemption</summary>
		  <p>The day after you arrive in Canada, all travellers, unless exempt from this requirement, must use ArriveCAN to:</p>
		  <ul>
		    <li>confirm that you've arrived at the address you provided for your quarantine or isolation location</li>
		    <li>complete daily COVID-19 symptom self-assessments until the completion of your quarantine period or until you report symptoms</li>
		  </ul>
		  <p>Government of Canada officials will call you to ensure that you're complying with your mandatory quarantine or isolation. You must answer calls from <strong>1-888-336-7735</strong> and answer all questions truthfully to demonstrate your compliance with the law. You may also receive a visit from a designated screening officer to confirm your compliance with the quarantine or isolation order.</p>
		  <p>If the provincial or territorial quarantine requirements in your area conflict with the federal quarantine requirements, please follow the directions that are more strict.</p>
		  <p>If you're directed to a designated quarantine facility, you won't have to report through ArriveCAN. However, you'll be subject to reporting requirements at the facility.</p>
		  <details>
		    <summary>How to report after you've entered Canada</summary>
		    <p id="report">How you report depends on whether you:</p>
		    <details>
		      <summary>Used ArriveCAN to enter Canada</summary>
		      <p>If you used the ArriveCAN mobile app before you entered Canada, you'll get a push notification on your phone and an email on the second day of your quarantine. If you signed in online to provide your information, you’ll only get an email notification. This means the day after you entered Canada. The notification alerts you that you're ready to confirm:</p>
		      <ul>
		        <li>your arrival at your place of quarantine or isolation</li>
		        <li>you can start your daily symptom reporting through ArriveCAN</li>
		      </ul>
		      <p>You'll be able to complete your mandatory reporting in less than a minute.</p>
		      <p>When you open the mobile app or sign in online, you'll  prompts to help you complete your daily check-in. If you are using the mobile app, you'll receive daily emails and notifications. If ArriveCAN shows the incorrect day of your quarantine period, follow the instructions provided by the Border Services Officer.</p>
		      <p>On day 9 of your quarantine period, you'll be asked if you've taken your COVID-19 test on day 8, and if you've sent your sample to the lab. If you are exempt from this requirement, answer 'no' to these questions.</p>
		      <p>If you are unable to use ArriveCAN after entering the country, call 1-833-641-0343 daily during your quarantine period.</p>
		    </details>
		    <details>
		      <summary>Didn't use ArriveCAN to enter Canada</summary>
		      <p>If you submitted your information verbally to a Canada border services officer or by paper form when you entered Canada, you can't use ArriveCAN to complete your mandatory reporting. You must call 1-833-641-0343 instead. It will take approximately 5 minutes to complete your daily reporting. Each traveller must call individually. For example, if you are a family of four, you need to make 4 separate phone calls.</p>
