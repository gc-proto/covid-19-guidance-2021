    </summary>
    <p>
        A positive molecular pre-entry test result taken less than 10 calendar days before your planned entry or flight to Canada 
        <strong>is not a valid</strong>
         test result for entry to Canada.
    </p>
    <p>
        A positive antigen pre-entry test result is 
        <strong>never</strong>
         a valid test result for boarding a flight or entry to Canada, not even if it is from within 10 to 180 calendar days before your date of entry.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Foreign nationals</strong>
         with symptoms or with a positive result from less than 10 calendar days before arriving will be denied entry.

    <p>
        <strong>Canadians</strong>
        : To avoid being fined $5,000 per traveller (plus surcharges), wait to enter Canada at least 10 calendar days after your positive molecular test result. If travelling by air, you’ll be denied boarding.  Counting starts the day following the day of testing.

        <li>
            if you had a positive antigen test result, you must either:
                        
            <ul>
                <li>wait until you obtain a negative antigen test result,</li>
                <li>obtain a positive molecular test result to use after 10 days have passed from the date the molecular test was taken, or</li>
