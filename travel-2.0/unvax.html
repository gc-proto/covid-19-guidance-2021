				before entering Canada. For the positive test, counting starts the day following the day of testing.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>For example, if your child’s positive COVID-19 molecular test was taken on January 1, the first day
					your child could use it for entry into Canada by land or water would be January 11. If your child is
					flying, the earliest scheduled departure date of their flight to Canada would be January 11.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>For the next 14 days, the children must also:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>not attend school, camp, team sports or daycare</li>
				<li>not attend large or crowded settings, indoors or outdoors, such as an amusement park or sporting
					event</li>
				<li>not take buses, subways, trains or other crowded transportation</li>
				<li>not attend a setting where they may have contact with vulnerable people (e.g. long term care
					facility), including people who are immunocompromised, regardless of that person’s vaccination
					status or public health measures</li>
				<li>stay in a place that allows the child to avoid all contact with any person that:
					<ul>
						<li>has an underlying medical condition that makes the person susceptible to complications
							related to COVID-19</li>
						<li>has a compromised immune system from a medical condition or treatment; or</li>
						<li>is 65 years of age or older</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>limit contact with others:
					<ul>
						<li>remain with their fully vaccinated parent or guardian, as much as possible</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>wear a mask and physically distance when in contact with non-household members </li>
			</ul>

			<p>What your child can do for the next 14 days, as long as they wear a mask and physically distance from
				non-household members:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>visit uncrowded public settings such as parks, beaches or going for a walk </li>
				<li>gather with a small group of people from outside the household who are all known to be fully
					vaccinated</li>
				<li>take uncrowded public transportation such as a taxi, or rideshare provided masks are worn at all
					times by all parties</li>
				<li>accompany you to essential settings such as a grocery store or pharmacy</li>
			</ul>

			<p>For 14 days following entry into Canada, you and any unvaccinated children under the age of 12 who
				travelled with you must: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>maintain a list of the names and contact information of each person with whom the child came into
					close contact and a list of locations visited</li>
				<li>wear a well-constructed, well-fitting mask in public settings</li>
				<li>keep a copy of the following and provide them on request to the Government of Canada or government
					of the province or territory where you are located, or to the local public health authority:
					<ul>
						<li>all COVID-19 pre-arrival test results</li>
						<li>all on-arrival COVID-19 test results</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>monitor for signs and symptoms of COVID-19. If the child develops signs or symptoms or tests
					positive for COVID-19, you must immediately:
					<ul>
						<li>isolate them for 10 days in a designated area of the home that can ensure minimal contact
							with other household members </li>
						<li>contact the appropriate public health authority, as specified below, and follow their
							instructions</li>
						<li>report it immediately to the Public Health Agency of Canada by calling 1-833-641-0343. A
							Public Health Agency of Canada official will provide you with additional details and
							instructions</li>
						<li>follow all <a
								href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/symptoms/provincial-territorial-resources-covid-19.html">local
								public health</a> requirements</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>If the child receives an indeterminate or invalid test result, they are required to take another test.
				Please contact your testing provider within 24 hours of receiving your test result to make arrangements
				to complete another self-swab kit. </p>
