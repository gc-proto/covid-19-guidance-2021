                  <li>have access to basic necessities without leaving your place of quarantine</li>
                  <li>won't be in a group living environment</li>
                  <li>are sharing your place of quarantine with someone in an at risk group</li>
                  <li>have a separate bedroom and bathroom</li>

            </div>

<p>Based on the information you provided, the person you're sharing your place of quarantine with <strong>must consent</strong> to you staying with them.</p>
  
<p><strong>Complete a consent form at the time of entry:</strong> A government representative at the port of entry will request information from you to complete a form confirming the consent and giving authorization to proceed. This form cannot be completed in advance. To complete the assessment at the border, a government representative will call the person to obtain their consent. You will need to provide their:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>legal name</li>
         <li>date of birth</li>
         <li>full address</li>
         <li>phone number</li>
      </ul>

<p>If the person is your parent or a minor in a parent-minor relationship with you, they must agree to quarantine
   with you as well as part of the consent form process.</p>
            <p><strong>Throughout your quarantine</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>avoid contact with others</li>
               <li>stay in separate rooms</li>
               <li>use a separate bathroom</li>
               <li>keep surfaces clean</li>
               <li>avoid sharing personal items</li>
               <li>limit interactions with others in the household</li>
            </ul>
  
            <p><strong>Mandatory hotel stay:</strong> On arrival to Canada, you will be required to take a COVID-19 test before you leave the airport. Following the test, you will await the results in your reserved stop over hotel. If you receive a negative result on your arrival test, you may be able to move on to your place of quarantine.
