    <p>You indicated that you are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>a Canadian citizen, a permanent resident of Canada, a person registered under the <cite>Indian

    <p>Based on your answers, <strong>you can enter Canada </strong>.  You must meet pre-entry and arrival test requirements and have an ArriveCAN receipt ready at the border. If you fail to meet the requirements, you may face a fine of up to $5,000 plus additional surcharges or face criminal prosecution. </p>
</section>
<h2 class="h3">You must have a valid medical contraindication</h2>
<p>The only medical reasons that prevent you from completing a COVID-19 vaccine dosage regimen that will be considered valid are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>one listed in the terms of market authorization of the COVID-19 vaccines in your country of residence
        <ul>
            <li>for example, for the Pfizer Comirnaty vaccine in Canada, contraindications that you are allergic (hypersensitive) to any of the ingredients in the vaccine, that you had a severe allergic reaction after a previous dose of the Comirnaty vaccine, or that you are receiving anti-coagulant therapy or have a bleeding disorder for which an intra-muscular should not be given. </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>The valid medical reason must be described in a letter that you have from a physician who is licensed to practice medicine in that country.   </p>

<h2 class="h3">What you need to do next</h2>
<p>In order to be exempt from quarantine, <strong>you must:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>meet the <a href="https://travel.gc.ca/travel-covid/travel-restrictions/exemptions#medical-reasons">testing and ArriveCAN requirements for travellers unable to receive a COVID-19 vaccination for medical reasons.</a>  These requirements include that you must provide proof of a valid pre-entry test result.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If you have COVID,</strong> you should isolate yourself for 10 days. You won't be allowed to board a flight to Canada, despite having a valid pre-entry test result, if you:</p>
<ul>
   <li>suspect or know you have COVID-19 </li>
   <li>have had COVID-19 within the last 10 days</p>
   <li>have <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/symptoms.html#s">signs or symptoms of COVID-19</a></li>
</ul>

        <span id="positive-results">What to do if you get positive results on your pre-entry test</span>
    </summary>
    <p>
        A positive molecular pre-entry test result taken less than 10 calendar days before your planned entry or flight to Canada 
        <strong>is not a valid</strong>
         test result for entry to Canada.
    </p>
    <p>
        A positive antigen pre-entry test result is 
        <strong>never</strong>
         a valid test result for boarding a flight or entry to Canada, not even if it is from within 10 to 180 calendar days before your date of entry.
    </p>
    <p>
        To avoid being fined $5,000 per traveller (plus surcharges), wait to enter Canada at least 10 calendar days after your positive molecular test result. If travelling by air, you’ll be denied boarding.  Counting starts the day following the day of testing.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>for example, if your positive COVID-19 molecular test was taken on January 1, then January 11 would be the first day you could use it</li>
        <li>January 11 would be the earliest scheduled departure date of your flight to Canada, or the first day you could use it to enter Canada by land or water</li>
        <li>
            if you had a positive antigen test result, you must either:
                        
            <ul>
                <li>wait until you obtain a negative antigen test result,</li>
                <li>obtain a positive molecular test result to use after 10 days have passed from the date the molecular test was taken, or</li>
                <li>obtain a negative molecular test result which can be used within 72 hours of your scheduled flight or entry to Canada by land or water</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>if your positive proof is accepted you won’t have to take arrival or Day-8 tests</li>
    
    </ul>
