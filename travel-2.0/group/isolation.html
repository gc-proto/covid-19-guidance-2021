            <p>First, determine whether you can enter Canada.</p>

                    no symptoms</strong>, you must <strong>quarantine</strong> for a minimum of 14 days.</p>

            <p>At this time, you are not excluded from quarantine, even if you have:</p>

            <p><strong>Flying into Canada</strong> – your quarantine period includes a mandatory 3 night pre-paid

            <h3 id="plan">Assess your quarantine plan</h3>

            <p>As a traveller, you <strong>must</strong> demonstrate that you have a suitable plan for quarantine.
            <ul>
                <li>You’re expected to make these plans, within your own means, before travelling to Canada. </li>
                <li><strong>Foreign nationals</strong> who do not have a suitable plan may be denied entry into Canada.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Assess whether your plan is likely to be considered suitable:</p>

            <p>You'll need to confirm you have a suitable place to quarantine where you:</p>

                <li>stay for 14 days or possibly longer</li>
                <li>have access to the necessities of life, including water, food, medication and heat without leaving

                <p>Some travellers may be unable to quarantine at home or their final destination. In these cases,
                    travellers are expected to make alternative arrangements for their return to Canada. Although
                    alternative accommodations (e.g. with family or friends, or paid accommodation) may be suitable, the
                    Government of Canada does not reimburse for expenses incurred for accommodations, including hotels,
                    RV rentals and trailer park or campground fees.</p>
                <p>Make your quarantine plans in advance of your arrival to Canada. If you do not have an adequate place
                    to quarantine, you may be directed to a federal designated quarantine facility where you must remain
                    for 14 days.</p>
                <p>Before travellers are directed to a federal designated quarantine facility, government
                    representatives may work with them to confirm that all other options for quarantine accommodations
                    within their own means have been exhausted. </p>
                <p>These facilities are a <strong>last resort</strong> for travellers who have no options of meeting
                    quarantine requirements by other means.</p>
                <p>Where required, transportation from the border crossing to a federal designated quarantine facility
                    is provided by the Government of Canada.</p>

            <p>For example, if you arrive at 8:15 am on Thursday, October 1, then Thursday is considered day 1 of your
                quarantine period. Your quarantine period would end 14 full days later, at 11:59 pm on Wednesday,
                October 14 if you received your Day-10 negative test result</p>

            <p>If you begin to show symptoms during your quarantine, are exposed to another traveller with symptoms, or
                test positive for COVID-19, you must begin an additional 14 days of isolation.</p>

                    if they qualify for an exemption from mandatory testing or quarantine measures.</p>
                <p>Government representatives at the border use the information available at the time of entry to
                    determine what instructions will be provided to a traveller regarding their public health
                    obligations.</p>
                <p>Travellers must meet the relevant criteria to be considered an essential service provider under the
                    Emergency Orders. They may be exempt from the mandatory requirements if they meet the relevant
                    criteria and they are entering for the purpose of that function. Travellers who are exempt from
                    quarantine as essential service providers, are workers whose job is included in the Chief Public
                    Health Officer Group Exemption list (see <a

                <p>When you enter Canada, a government representative will ask questions and consider multiple factors,
                    including supporting documents and your previous travel history. They may ask for:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>your identification and proof of residence</li>
                    <li>confirmation of employment</li>
                    <li>confirmation of your normal place of employment</li>
                    <li>confirmation of your past travel history to establish a pattern of travel frequency</li>
                    <li>if required, demonstrated immediate nature of work required in Canada and why you are unable to
                        quarantine for 14 days</li>
                    <li>documentation from your employer as to why the travel is required and how the travel meets one
                        of the exemptions under the Emergency Order</li>
                </ul>
            </details>

            <p>There are strict requirements you must follow even if you are exempt from quarantine. You must:
            <ul>
                <li>wear a mask at all times when in public spaces</li>
                <li>maintain a list of all close contacts for your first 14 days in Canada</li>
                <li>monitor yourself for <a

            </ul>
            </p>

            <p>Although your reason for entering Canada may fall under an exemption, you may still have to follow
                certain <a href="/travel-covid/travel-restrictions/provinces">provincial and territorial
                    restrictions</a> (which may include quarantine), depending on your destination. Being exempt from

            <p>If you are arriving by land and show symptoms, you <strong>must</strong> demonstrate that you have an
                adequate plan for isolation to avoid infecting others. You are expected to make plans, within your own
                means, before travelling to Canada. If you do not have a suitable place, you will be directed to a
                federal quarantine facility.</p>

                <summary>Where you can isolate with symptoms</summary>
                <p>You'll need to confirm you have a suitable place to isolate where you:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>can stay for 14 days or possibly longer</li>
                    <li>have access to the necessities of life, including water, food, medication and heat without
                        leaving isolation</li>
                    <li>can avoid contact with others who did not travel with you</li>
                    <li>have no visits from family or guests</li>
                </ul>
                <p>You must isolate in a place where you won't have contact with people who:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>are 65 years or older</li>
                    <li>have underlying medical conditions</li>
                    <li>have compromised immune systems</li>
                    <li>work or assist in a facility, home or workplace that includes at-risk populations,
                        including:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Nurses, doctors, other healthcare professionals, personal support workers, social
                                workers, and developmental services support staff</li>
                            <li>First responders, such as paramedics, police officers, firefighters</li>

                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>You may only isolate with people in these situations if:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>they consent to the isolation or are the parent or minor in a parent-minor relationship</li>
                    <li>you complete a form with a government representative at the border crossing explaining the
                        consent and receive authorization to proceed</li>
                </ul>

                <p>In these limited circumstances, a government representative will confirm consent.</p>

                <h3>You cannot isolate in group living environments</h3>

                <p>Some examples include:
                <ul>
                    <li>a shelter, group home, group residence, hostels, industrial camps, construction trailers or
                        other group setting</li>
                    <li>a student residence (unless you’ve received prior authorization)</li>
                    <li>a small apartment you share with others</li>
                    <li>a shared household with a large family or families or many people</li>
                    <li>shared living spaces with housemates who haven’t travelled with you that you cannot avoid
                        interacting with</li>
