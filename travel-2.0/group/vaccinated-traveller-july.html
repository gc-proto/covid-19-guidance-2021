         <p>Fully vaccinated travellers who arrived before 12:01 a.m. EDT on July 5, aren’t eligible for these
            exemptions. If you returned to Canada before this time, you must complete your 14-day quarantine and a Day-8
            test.</p>

         <p>You may qualify for certain exemptions to quarantine and testing requirements if you:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>are <a href="/travel-covid/travel-restrictions/wizard-start">eligible to enter Canada</a></li>

               in ArriveCAN before arrival</li>
         </ul>
         <p>Those who meet the requirements may be exempt from:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>quarantine</li>
            <li>hotel stopover (for air travellers)</li>
            <li>day-8 testing requirement</li>

         <p>Travel restrictions on who can enter Canada remain in place.</p>
         <p>Foreign nationals (including U.S. citizens) coming to Canada for non-essential reasons will be turned away

         <p>Follow the instructions provided to you upon entry to Canada to complete your arrival (day 1) test. Airports
