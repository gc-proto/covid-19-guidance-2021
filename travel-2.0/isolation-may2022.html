		<!-- <h2 id="isolation">With symptoms: Mandatory isolation</h2> -->


		<h3 id="who-isolate">Who must isolate after entering Canada</h3>
		<p><mark>FROM HANDOUT</mark>Every person who enters Canada must isolate themselves for 10 days without delay in accordance with the
			instructions below if they:</p>
		<ul>

			<li>know that they have COVID-19 <strong>or</strong></li>
			<li>exhibit signs and symptoms of COVID-19 <strong>or</strong></li>
			<li>have received a positive result for any type of COVID-19 test (taken!) less than 10 days before the day
				on which they enter Canada <strong>or</strong></li>
			<li>have reasonable grounds to suspect they have COVID-19</li>

		</ul>
		<p><strong>Positive arrival or Day-8 test results:</strong> you must isolate yourself from others immediately
			for a period of 10 days beginning on the day you tested positive for COVID-19, which is the day you took the
			test. A government representative will call you to provide additional details and instructions. <mark>This
				applies only to the onsite tests at the airport after you arrived, or results from the self swab kits
				provided to you at the border. </mark></p>
		<p><strong>Canadians arriving with symptoms or a positive test result within 10 days before entering:</strong>
		</p>
		<p>Only Canadian citizens, permanent residents, persons registered under the <cite>Indian Act</cite>, and
			protected persons (refugee status) may enter Canada with symptoms or a current positive test result.</p>
		<p><strong>You must go directly to the place where you will isolate</strong> and stay there for 10 days. This is
			mandatory and starts the day you arrive in Canada. If you test positive in Canada (for example, when you
			arrive or on your Day-8 test), you must isolate for 10 days starting on the date you took that test.
			<mark>what if arrival is negative? do vax travellers with symptoms not get an arrival test no matter
				what?</mark>
		</p>
		<p>During the 10-day period from the time you enter Canada, you’re required to answer any relevant questions
			asked by a Government of Canada employee.</p>
		<mark>this section is all about entering - why would they look for it here?? DELETE</mark>
		<p>You won’t be able to board a flight and enter Canada by air if you have symptoms or have a positive test
			result taken less than 10 days before your travel. The test must have been taken at least 10 calendar days
			and no more than 180 calendar days before the scheduled departure date of your flight to Canada. Counting
			starts the day following the day of testing.</p>

		<ul>
			<li>For example, if your positive COVID-19 molecular test was taken on January 1, the first day you could
				use it for entry into Canada by land or water would be January 11. If you’re flying, the earliest
				scheduled departure date of your flight to Canada would be January 11.</li>
		</ul>



		<h3 id="plan-isolation">Isolating upon returning to Canada</h3><mark>isn't this already covered above?</mark>
		<p>If you’re arriving by air and begin to have symptoms you may be directed to a federal quarantine facility if
			you don’t have a suitable place of isolation, including if you have private transportation to your place of
			isolation.<mark>Really? You've got allergies and 4 doses of vaccine, off you go with no testing?</mark></p>
		<p>If you’re arriving by land and show symptoms or have a positive test result taken within the last 10 days.
			You <strong>must</strong> demonstrate that you have an adequate plan for isolation to avoid infecting
			others. You’re expected to make plans, within your own means, before travelling to Canada. If you don’t have
			a suitable place, you’ll be directed to a federal quarantine facility.</p>

		<h3 id="fed-prov-terr-requirements">When federal and provincial or territorial requirements are different</h3>
		<p>Some federal rules for quarantine and isolation after entering Canada are different from the provincial or
			territorial rules. In this case, you must follow the stricter rules.</p>
		<p>For example, if you must isolate after testing positive on your arrival test, mandatory isolation is for 10
			days, even if your province only requires 5 days of isolation.</p>


		<h2>Where you can isolate</h2>

		<h3>Do <mark>FROM HANDOUT</mark></h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Avoid contact with others who did not travel with you, and if isolating, sleep in a separate bedroom.
			</li>
			<li>Access the necessities of life (such as water, food, medication, and heat) without leaving your place of
				quarantine or isolation.</li>
			<li>Respond to calls or visits from screening officers or law enforcement.
				<ul>
					<li>You will receive live or automated calls from 1-888-336-7735 and must answer all questions
						truthfully to demonstrate your compliance with the law.</li>
					<li>You may also receive in-person visits from a screening officer at your place of quarantine.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>If you are isolating, you must also avoid all in-person interaction with others, including members of
				your household/group.
				<ul>
					<li>When unable, everyone should wear a medical mask.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Don't</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Do not use shared spaces, such as lobbies, courtyards, restaurants, gyms or pools.</li>
			<li>Do not have any visitors.</li>
			<li>Do not leave your place of quarantine or isolation except for an essential medical service or treatment,
				or to obtain a COVID-19 test.
				<ul>
					<li>If you need to seek medical care, you must:
						<ul>
							<li>wear a medical mask</li>
							<li>use a private vehicle and do not take public transportation</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<details>
			<summary>Getting to your place of isolation (final destination) <mark>OUT OF DATE</mark></summary>
			<ul>
				<li>Go directly to your place of isolation without delay and stay there for 10 days from the date you
					arrived in Canada</li>
				<li>Do not use public transportation (e.g. aircraft, bus, train, subway, taxi or ride-sharing service)
					to get to your place of isolation. </li>
				<li>Wear a well-constructed, well-fitting mask while in transit, unless you are alone in a private
					vehicle.</li>
				<li>Remain in the vehicle as much as possible: pay at the pump for gas and use drive through when you
					need food.</li>
				<li>Avoid stops and contact with others while in transit.</li>
				<li>Sanitize your hands frequently. </li>
				<li>We encourage all travellers to check <a
						href="/travel-covid/travel-restrictions/provinces">provincial and territorial restrictions</a>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</details>
		<p>You'll need to confirm you have a suitable place to isolate where you:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>can stay for 10 days or possibly longer</li>
			<li>have access to the necessities of life, including water, food, medication and heat without
				leaving isolation</li>
			<li>can avoid contact with others who did not travel with you</li>
			<li>have no visits from family, friends or guests</li>
			<li>can use a separate bedroom and bathroom; you may only use a shared bathroom if permitted by a quarantine
				officer</li>
		</ul>
		<p>You must isolate in a place where you won't have contact with people who:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>are 65 years or older</li>
			<li>have underlying medical conditions</li>
			<li>have compromised immune systems</li>
			<li>work or assist in a facility, home or workplace that includes at-risk populations,
				including:
				<ul>
					<li>Nurses, doctors, other healthcare professionals, personal support workers, social
						workers, and developmental services support staff</li>
					<li>First responders, such as paramedics, police officers, firefighters</li>
					<li>Cleaning and maintenance staff, receptionists and administrative staff, food
						services staff, volunteers, essential visitors to those living in long-term care
						facilities</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>You may only isolate with people in these situations if:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>they consent to the isolation or are the parent or minor in a parent-minor relationship</li>
			<li>you complete a form with a government representative at the border crossing explaining the consent and
				receive authorization to proceed</li>
		</ul>

		<p>In these limited circumstances, a government representative will confirm consent.</p>

		<h3>You cannot isolate in group living environments</h3>

		<p>Some examples include:
		<ul>
			<li>a shelter, group home, group residence, hostels, industrial camps, construction trailers or
				other group setting</li>
			<li>a student residence (unless you’ve received prior authorization)</li>
			<li>a small apartment you share with others</li>
			<li>a shared household with a large family or families or many people</li>
			<li>shared living spaces with housemates who haven’t travelled with you that you cannot avoid
				interacting with</li>
		</ul>
