				COVID-19: Proof of vaccination</h1>

			<h2>What is Canadian COVID-19 proof of vaccination</h2>
			<p>You may already have the Canadian COVID-19 proof of vaccination from your province or territory. We
				expect the Canadian COVID-19 proof of vaccination to be issued by all provinces and territories soon.
			</p>
			<p>The Canadian COVID-19 proof of vaccination is a reliable way to show
				proof of your COVID-19 vaccination
				history when travelling internationally and within Canada. </p>
			<p>This proof</p>
			<ul>
				<li>was developed by provinces and territories, with support from the Government of Canada</li>
				<li>is a recognized, trusted document that has been shared with our international partners</li>
			</ul>
			<p>You should <strong>avoid non-essential travel</strong>, but if you need to travel, this proof</p>
			<ul>
				<li>shows your COVID-19 vaccination history</li>
				<li>can be verified after you upload it into ArriveCAN (on your return to Canada)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This proof <strong>does not</strong> guarantee you entry to another country. Before you travel, you must
				check the rules of your destination country and the countries you transit through.</p>
			<p>You’ll need to show your proof of vaccination when travelling in Canada by air, rail or cruise ship as of
				October 30, 2021. The new Canadian COVID-19 proof of vaccination may be used to show that you meet this
				requirement.</p>
			<p>Provinces and territories may also ask you to use this proof to access non-essential services.</p>

				<p>If you have the Canadian COVID-19 proof of vaccination, and your vaccination history has not
					changed, you
					don’t need to get a new one. Be sure to bring a digital <strong>and</strong> paper copy with
					you when
					you travel.</p>

					<summary>If you don’t have the Canadian COVID-19 proof of vaccination</summary>

					<h3 id="safe">A safe way to share your vaccination history</h3>
				</summary>
				<p>The Canadian COVID-19 proof of vaccination uses the internationally recognized SMART
					Health Card
					standard. It provides a safe and secure way to share limited information about your
					COVID-19
					vaccination history when you travel.</p>
				<h3>About the SMART Health Card standard</h3>
				<p>A SMART Health Card is a secure and verifiable health record that's digitally signed by
					the issuing
					province or territory.</p>
				<p>The SMART Health Card uses technology that enables</p>
				<ul>
					<li>the verification of the information stored in the QR code
						<ul>
							<li>The QR code lets someone verify the document without giving access to other
								personal
								health information.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>the detection of any tampering or forgery
						<ul>
							<li>Any changes to the card or its information after it’s been issued would make
								that card
								invalid.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>you to keep a digital copy of your proof of vaccination on any device, like a mobile
						phone or
						tablet</li>
				</ul>
			</details>
			<details>
				<summary>
					<h3 id="privacy">Protecting your privacy</h3>
				</summary>
				<p>The proof of vaccination shows only a record of your vaccination status. It doesn’t
					expose any of
					your other health data. The management of your health data is the responsibility of your
					province,
					territory or Indigenous organization. </p>
				<p>If you travel, you’ll need to present your proof of vaccination <strong>and</strong>
					another form of
					identification (ID), like your passport or status card. </p>
				<ul>
					<li>Your name and date of birth will be checked against your other ID, such as your
						passport or
						status card.</li>
					<li>Your proof of vaccination and your passport or status card are separate documents
						and are not
						digitally connected.</li>
					<li>Your Canadian passport or status card does not contain vaccination information.</li>
