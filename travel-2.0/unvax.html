				<p>Some travellers may be unable to quarantine at home or their final destination. In these cases,
					travellers are expected to make alternative arrangements for their return to Canada. Although
					alternative accommodations (e.g. with family or friends, or paid accommodation) may be suitable,
					the
					Government of Canada does not reimburse for expenses incurred for accommodations, including
					hotels,
					RV
					rentals and trailer park or campground fees.</p>
				<p>Make your quarantine plans in advance of your arrival to Canada. Foreign nationals who do not
					have a
					suitable plan may be denied entry into Canada. If you do not have a suitable place to
					quarantine,
					you
					may be directed to a federal <a
						href="/travel-covid/travel-restrictions/isolation/designated-quarantine-facilities">designated
						quarantine facility</a> where you must remain for your entire mandatory quarantine. </p>

				<p>Before travellers are directed to a federal designated quarantine facility, government
					representatives
					may work with them to confirm that all other options for quarantine accommodations within their
					own
					means have been exhausted. </p>
				<p>These facilities are a <strong>last resort</strong> for travellers who have no options of meeting
					quarantine requirements by other means.</p>
				<p>Where required, transportation from the border crossing to a federal designated quarantine
					facility
					is
					provided by the Government of Canada.</p>

				<p>If you’re instructed to go to a designated quarantine facility, you have the right to retain

		<h2 id="how-to-quarantine">How to quarantine</h2>
		<p>Travellers who don't qualify as fully vaccinated must quarantine for 14 days to limit the spread of COVID-19
			and
			variants in Canada.</p>
		<details>
			<summary><span id="place-of-quarantine">Getting to your place of quarantine</span></summary>
			<p>While you travel, you must wear a mask and practice physical distancing at all times.</p>
			<p><strong>Public health measures to follow while in transit to your suitable place of
					quarantine:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>You can use public transportation (e.g. bus, subway, taxi or ride-sharing service) to get to
					your place of quarantine, however practice physical distancing of at least 2 metres whenever
					possible.</li>
				<li>Wear a well-constructed, well-fitting mask while in transit, unless you are alone in a private
					vehicle or traveling only with the same people you entered Canada with.</li>
				<li>Avoid contact with others and sanitize your hands frequently. </li>
				<li>If driving, avoid stops and remain in the vehicle as much as possible: pay at the pump for gas
					and use a drive through if you need to stop for food.</li>
			</ul>

			<p><a href="/travel-covid/travel-restrictions/provinces">Check provincial or territorial
					requirements</a></p>

		</details>
		<p>While in quarantine:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Do not</strong> leave your place of quarantine unless it is for a medical emergency, an
				essential medical service or treatment, to obtain a COVID-19 test, or it is pre-authorized by a
				Quarantine Officer</li>
			<li><strong>Use only</strong> private outdoor spaces (i.e. balcony)</li>
			<li><strong>Do not</strong> have any visits from friends, family or other guests</li>
			<li><strong>Do not</strong> use shared spaces such as lobbies, courtyards, restaurants, gyms or pools
			</li>
		</ul>

		<details>
			<summary><span id="quarantine-start-end"></span>Starting, ending and leaving quarantine</span></summary>


			<p>Your quarantine period begins <strong>on the day that you arrive in Canada</strong>. </p>

			<p>For example, if you arrive at 8:15 am on Thursday, October 1, then Thursday is considered day 1 of
				your
				quarantine period. Your quarantine period would end 14 full days later, at 11:59 pm on Wednesday,
				October 14. </p>

			<p>If you start to show symptoms during your quarantine, or test positive for COVID-19, you must isolate
				for
				10 days. Your first day of isolation starts on the earliest of the date:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>you took the test</li>
				<li>you received your test result (if the test date is not available) or </li>
				<li>when the symptoms started</li>
			</ul>
			<p>If someone you travelled with develops symptoms or tests positive, you must start a new 14-day
				quarantine
				period. It starts from your last exposure to them.</p>

			<details>
				<summary><span id="medical-emergencies">COVID-19 testing or medical emergencies while in

					person to accompany you, which can include a person who is also under mandatory quarantine.</p>
				<p>If the person who needs to visit a health care facility is a dependent child, the exception
					extends
					to one other person who accompanies them.</p>
