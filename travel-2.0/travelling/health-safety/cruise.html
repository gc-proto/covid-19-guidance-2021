<h2 id="cruise">Avoid all travel on cruise ships</h2>
	<p><strong>Avoid all non-essential travel outside Canada until further notice, including on cruise
			ships.</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/travel-health-notices/221">Notice to avoid all
				non-essential travel outside Canada</a></li>
	</ul>
	<p>If an outbreak of COVID-19 were to occur on a cruise ship while you are outside of Canada:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>you could be subject to quarantine procedures onboard ship or in a foreign country</li>
		<li>the range of consular services available to those on cruise ships may be significantly restricted by local
			authorities, especially in situations of quarantine</li>
		<li>it is unlikely that there would be a government-organized repatriation flight to return to Canada
		</li>
	</ul>
<h2 id="cruise-ban">Ban on cruise vessels in Canadian waters</h2>
	<p>Cruise vessels in all Canadian waters and pleasure craft in Canadian Arctic water are prohibited until February
		28, 2022. This means:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>adventure-seeking pleasure craft are prohibited from entering Arctic waters</li>
		<li>passenger vessels carrying more than 12 people are prohibited from entering Arctic coastal waters, including
			Nunatsiavut, Nunavik, and the Labrador Coast</li>
		<li>cruise vessels carrying more than 100 people are prohibited from operating in Canadian waters.</li>
		<li>smaller cruise ships certified to carry 100 or fewer people are not banned</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The Government of Canada will continue to evaluate the situation and make changes as necessary to ensure the
		health and safety of all Canadians. Should the COVID-19 pandemic sufficiently improve to allow the resumption of
		these activities, the Minister of Transport has the ability to rescind the ban.&nbsp;</p>
