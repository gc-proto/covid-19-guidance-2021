    <p>Persons who have recovered from COVID-19 can continue to test positive long after they have recovered and are no
        longer infectious. </p>
    <p>Travellers who have previously tested positive for COVID-19 <strong>must provide proof</strong> of a
        <strong>positive</strong> COVID-19 molecular test conducted between 14 and 90 days prior to your entry into

</details>

<details>
    <summary><span id="accepted-tests">Accepted types of tests</span></summary>
    <p>These tests are considered acceptable molecular tests:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>PCR - Polymerase chain reaction</li>
        <li>RT-PCR – reverse transcription real time PCR</li>
        <li>Quantitative PCR (qPCR)</li>
        <li>Nucleic acid test (NAT) or Nucleic acid amplification test (NAATs)</li>
        <li>Reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP)</li>
        <li>Isothermal amplification</li>
        <li>Droplet digital PCR or digital droplet PCR (ddPCR)</li>
        <li>Transcription-mediated amplification (TMA)</li>
        <li>RNA (Ribonucleic acid)</li>
        <li>Ct (cycle threshold) </li>
        <li>CRISPR</li>
        <li>Sequencing</li>

        <li>Detection of the E gene</li>
        <li>Detection of the RdRp gene</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These tests use methods such as a nasopharyngeal (NP) swab, nose swab, or saliva sample. At this time, proof of
        having a vaccine will not replace a negative test result.</p>

        from specific accredited laboratories or facilities.</p>
</details>



<h2 class="h3" id="proof-result">Providing proof of your result</h2>
<p>You must present an accepted test result (paper or electronic proof) which must include:
<ul>
    <li>Traveller name and date of birth</li>
    <li>Name and civic address of the laboratory/clinic/facility that administered the test</li>
    <li>The date on which the test was conducted</li>

    <li>The test result</li>
</ul>
<p>You <strong>must</strong> show proof of your test results even if you:</p>
<ul>
    <li>have tested negative for COVID-19 before the 72 hour period</li>
    <li>have been vaccinated for COVID-19</li>
    <li>recovered from COVID-19 and no longer test positive</li>
    <li>recovered from COVID-19 and <a href="#recovered">continue to test positive</a></li>
</ul>
<p>At this time, we encourage travellers to make best efforts to have their test performed at a reputable laboratory or
    testing facility (i.e., one recognized by the local government or accredited by a third party, such as a
    professional organization or international standards organization).</p>

<details>
    <summary id="testing-facilities">Testing facilities and expenses</summary>
    <p>Canadian government offices abroad do not provide medical attention (including administering COVID-19 testing) or

<details>
    <summary id="testing-positive">Testing positive or possible exposure within 14 days of your return</summary>
    <p>Keep your pre-entry test results for 14 days. In addition, you will be required to isolate and keep your test

    <ul>
        <li>develop signs and symptoms of COVID-19</li>

<details>
    <summary><span id="fraudulent-test">Fraudulent test results</span></summary>
    <p>All travellers arriving in Canada are obligated by Canadian law to respond truthfully to all questions. Providing
        false information to a Government of Canada official upon entry to Canada is a serious offence and may result in
        penalties and/or criminal charges. Foreign nationals who provide false information could also be denied entry to
        the country and/or be barred from returning to Canada.</p>
    <p>Making a false declaration when entering Canada at the land border, including the presentation of a fraudulent
        test result, carries the potential of a fine of $3000 under the <cite>Quarantine Act</cite> for individuals.
    </p>
    <p>Violating any instructions provided when you enter Canada or putting others at risk of a serious communicable
        disease are offences under the <cite>Quarantine Act</cite> and could lead to up to three years in prison and/or
        up to $1 million in fines.</p>

<h2><span id="create-account">Create a Switch Health account</span></h2>
<p>Switch Health has been hired by the Public Health Agency of Canada to manage the COVID-19 test kits at all land
    border crossings. You must create an account with them to perform your test and access your results. Creating your
    account in advance may save time at the border.</p>
<p>Use the same email address you used for ArriveCAN.</p>

<h2><span id="arrival-testing">Arrival testing</span></h2>

<p>If you’re entering Canada at the land border crossing, you’ll get 2 COVID-19 At Home Specimen Collection kits: one to
    use on the day you arrive in Canada and another to use on Day-8 of our mandatory quarantine.</p>
<p>Your kits contain all of the instructions.</p>
<p><strong>Do not open your swab or tube</strong> until you are instructed to do so by a telehealth healthcare provider.
    This can cause contamination, or result in a delay in receiving your test result. </p>
