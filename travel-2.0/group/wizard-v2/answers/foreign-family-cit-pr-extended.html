      <summary>How to complete your application for authorization and statutory declaration form</summary>
      <p id="declaration">You must complete your declaration before requesting authorization.</p>
   
      <h4>Step 1: Your family member fills out the application for authorization and statutory declaration form</h4>
      <p>Your family member who is the Canadian citizen or permanent resident must fill out the <a
            href="https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/ircc/documents/pdf/english/kits/forms/imm0006e-2020-10-09.pdf">application

            2020</span></p>
      <h4>Step 2: You sign the declaration</h4>
      <p>Your family member in Canada sends you the filled out <a
            href="https://www.canada.ca//content/dam/ircc/documents/pdf/english/kits/forms/imm0006e-2020-10-09.pdf">application
            for authorization and
            statutory declaration (IMM 0006) (PDF, 2.2 MB)</a>&nbsp;<span class="label label-info">Updated October 9,
            2020</span> for you to sign. After you sign the form, you send it back to your family member in Canada.</p>
      <h4>Step 3: Your family member signs the form by solemn declaration</h4>
      <p>Once you’ve sent the form back to your family member in Canada, they must sign the form by solemn declaration.
         This
         is done in front of any official who is legally authorized to receive a solemn declaration, such as a commissioner
         for
         oaths, justice of the peace, lawyer or notary public.</p>
      <h4>Step 4: Get a copy of the completed and signed form</h4>
      <p>Your family member in Canada must send you a copy of the completed and signed <a
            href="https://www.canada.ca//content/dam/ircc/documents/pdf/english/kits/forms/imm0006e-2020-10-09.pdf">application

            2020</span></p>
      <h4>Step 5: Request written authorization to travel</h4>
      <p>Once you have a copy of the completed and signed <a

            2020</span> use it as evidence of your relationship with your family member and request a written authorization
         from
         us. <strong>You need written authorization from us whether you’re travelling from the United States&nbsp;(U.S.) or
            any
            other country.</strong></p>
      <p>How you request a written authorization depends on whether or not you already have a valid travel document
         (visitor
         visa or eTA).</p>
      <p><a href="#request-ircc-extended">Find out how to request authorization</a>.</p>
   
      <p><strong>You should not book a flight to Canada until you get your written authorization from us.</strong></p>
      <h4>Step 6: Bring the copy of the application for authorization and statutory declaration as well as the written
         authorization with you when you travel.</h4>
      <p>You must have a copy of the application for authorization and statutory declaration as well as the written
         authorization with you when you travel. This is mandatory. If not, you won’t be allowed to board your flight or
         enter
         Canada.</p>
      <p>Once the form is signed by solemn declaration, <strong>you have 6 months to travel to Canada</strong>. If it’s
         longer
         than 6 months before you’ll be travelling, you’ll need a new statutory declaration.</p>
