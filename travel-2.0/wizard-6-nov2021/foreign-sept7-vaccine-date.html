    <summary>How the 14 days are calculated</summary>
    <p>Your last dose must have been given <strong>14 days before the day you enter</strong>.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>For example, if your last dose was anytime on <strong>Thursday July 1st</strong>, then
            <strong>Thursday July 15th</strong> would be the first day that you meet the 14 day condition
        </li>
        <li>If you are going to cross international date lines or time zones on your way to Canada, you must arrive in
            Canada on the date that is 14 days or later after your last dose.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>For example, if you received your last dose on a Thursday, and you arrive in Canada 2 weeks later on the
                Wednesday, you will not qualify. You would need to arrive on or after the Thursday 2 weeks later.</li>
