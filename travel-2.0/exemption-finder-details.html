<p>There are travel restrictions in place at all border crossings to reduce the spread of COVID-19 by travellers
    entering Canada. If you aren't sure whether these restrictions apply to you, answer a few questions to:<br>

<p>Find out if your work or personal situation are exempt from quarantine or testing requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Exempt means that you don't have to follow certain requirements</strong>. For example, if you are exempt from
    quarantine, you don't need to quarantine for 14 days after entering Canada or stay at a government-authorized hotel.

        end-of-life visit</summary>
    <p>Based on your reason for travel, you may apply for a limited release from quarantine for compassionate reasons.
        If youâ€™re approved, your limited release from quarantine is valid only for the location(s) and purpose specified
        in your application</p>
    <p>Some provinces and territories may not allow for limited release from quarantine for compassionate reasons. This
        means that even if you receive approval from the Public Health Agency of Canada a province or territory may have
        additional restrictions. In the event of conflicting requirements between federal restrictions and provincial or
        territorial travel restrictions, you must comply with those that are the most stringent.</p>
    <p>To apply for compassionate entry and limited release from quarantine for compassionate reasons, see <a
