               <h3>Indoor or private places</h3>

               <p>You need to attach a signed Site Visit Authorization Form to your application for
                  <strong>each</strong>&nbsp;site or location you plan to visit during your limited release from
                  quarantine. This includes:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>hospitals</li>
                  <li>funeral homes</li>
                  <li>places of worship</li>
                  <li>retirement homes</li>
                  <li>long-term care facilities</li>
                  <li>palliative care facilities, such as a hospice</li>

                  <ul>
                     <li>the death or end-of-life ceremony is occurring</li>

                  </ul>
               </ul>
               <p>The Site Visit Authorization form must be signed by the homeowner or tenant of a private residence, or
                  by a manager, administrator, or proprietor of each site. </p>

               <h3>Public outdoor places</h3>

               <p>You don't need a Site Visit Authorization Form if you're visiting a public outdoor setting
                  or site. For example, a ceremony in a public park.</p>

               <h3>Provincial and territorial restrictions</h3>

               <p>Before applying, please check provincial or territorial requirements.</p>

               <p>Some provinces and territories may not allow release from quarantine for compassionate
                  reasons. This
                  means that even if you receive approval from the Public Health Agency of Canada, a province or
                  territory may have
                  further travel restrictions that you must follow.</p>

               <p>Check back regularly as these restrictions can change.</p>
